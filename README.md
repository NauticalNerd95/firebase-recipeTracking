##  Overview of the project

This project is a complete **end-to-end ETL (Extract–Transform–Load) Data Engineering Pipeline** for analyzing user recipes. It takes data created by users in a Firebase Firestore backend and moves it across:

1. **Firestore Database**
2. **Local Python ETL Process**
3. **Validated CSV files**
4. **Google Sheets using Google Sheets API**
5. **Looker Studio for visual dashboards and insights**

This pipeline demonstrates how raw data from a live application can be:

- Extracted from a real database  
- Cleaned, validated, and structured  
- Loaded into analytics-friendly storage  
- Visualized for business insights

---

##  Project Goals

- Collect user recipe submissions (name, ingredients, prep time, steps, etc.) from Firestore  
- Convert Firestore recipe objects into structured CSV format  
- Validate the data  
- Automatically upload structured data to Google Sheets  
- Connect Google Sheets to Looker Studio  
- Build dashboards analyzing:
  - Most liked recipes  
  - Ingredient trends  
  - Time to prepare vs popularity  
  - User contribution metrics

---

##  Architecture

Firestore → Python ETL → CSV Files → Google Sheets → Looker Studio Dashboards

Here is the directory strucuture for my project

---

## 📂 CSV Output Files

The ETL produces four structured datasets:

| File | Description |
|---|---|
| `recipes.csv` | Master recipe information |
| `ingredients.csv` | Each ingredient linked to a recipe |
| `steps.csv` | Ordered cooking steps |
| `interactions.csv` | Likes, ratings, and user engagement |
| `users.csv` | Information about the users and their activity |

---

##  How the Pipeline Works

### 1️⃣ Extract – Firestore
The system connects to Firebase Firestore using the service key JSON and retrieves recipe documents.

---

### 2️⃣ Transform – In Python

Data transformations include:

- Flattening nested Firestore JSON structures  
- Ensuring proper data types  
- Cleaning missing values  
- Generating unique IDs (UUIDs)  
- Converting arrays (steps, ingredients) into normalized rows

*HERE IS SOME SNIPPET OF ETL CODE*
```python
def transform_recipe_data(recipes_data):
    recipes_master = []
    ingredients = []
    steps = []
    
    print("Transformation: Flattening nested recipe data (ingredients/steps)...")
    
    for recipe in recipes_data:
        recipe_id = recipe.get('recipe_id')
        
        master_row = {
            'recipe_id': recipe_id,
            'user_id': recipe.get('user_id'),
            'name': recipe.get('name'),
            'servings': recipe.get('servings'),
            'prep_time_min': recipe.get('prep_time_min'),
            'cook_time_min': recipe.get('cook_time_min'),
            'difficulty': recipe.get('difficulty'),
            'created_at': recipe.get('created_at', datetime.now()).isoformat() 
        }
        recipes_master.append(master_row)
        
        for ingredient in recipe.get('ingredients', []):
            ingredient_row = {
                'recipe_id': recipe_id, # This is the Foreign Key (FK)
                'ingredient_name': ingredient.get('name'),
                'quantity': ingredient.get('quantity'),
                'unit': ingredient.get('unit')
            }
            ingredients.append(ingredient_row)
```

### 3️⃣ Load – Write to CSV

Each dataset is written into individual CSV files locally:

recipes.csv
ingredients.csv
steps.csv
interactions.csv

---

### 4️⃣ Upload to Google Sheets

Using the Google Sheets API:

- Each CSV is automatically uploaded (using service account of GCP and enabling google sheets api)
- Each file becomes a worksheet  
- Data replaces previous records cleanly

---

### 5️⃣ Visualization in Looker Studio

Google Sheets is selected as a data source in Looker Studio.

Dashboards include:

- **Average prep time vs rating**
- **User contribution leaderboard**
- **Most common ingredients**
- **Recipe engagement analysis**

---

## 📊 Example Insights

- Some long preparation recipes score highly  
- A subset of ingredients appears in majority of dishes  
- Top contributors submit more liked recipes  
- Clear correlation between preparation time and likability
